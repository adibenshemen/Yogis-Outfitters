<div class="readmeContainer">
  <p>Store name: Yogis Outfitters<br><br>
    What are we selling: Yoga clothes and essentials<br><br>
    Additional pages we added to our online store:<br><br>
    1. About Us - telling about our brand.<br><br>
    2. Help - FAQ (frequently asked questions) about our store.<br><br>
    3. Contact Us - let users tell us what they think about our online store, contact with our team if they need and we can get back to them by email.<br><br>
    4. Products pages - we added a page for each product in our store, showing it’s name, description, price, available sizes and add to bag button, together with amount of pieces to choose.<br><br>
    What was hard to do? <br><br>
    At first, it was hard for me to imagine how I want the store to look like. We spent a lot of time designing the front of our website until we found a concept we liked and started working on the backend.
    It took me a day or two to get into it and understand how the whole thing works. I learned properly how to send requests to the server and how to get the responses I want, how to work with JSON, how to
    collaborate the front and back and create pages dynamically, which was difficult but also pretty amazing because I wasn’t familiar with this way of work before. It was hard sometimes to debug or to find
    out why things that worked already stopped working. I think nothing was easy in this project, but once I understood what I want to do and how I can get it, things started moving fast and I really enjoyed
    working on this project.<br><br>
    My partner was Tal Barak 302281480.<br>
    We met up a few times a week and worked together on the project. Tal helped me understand how to make the server and client communicate with each other and how to work with files. On the other hand,
    when Tal got stuck with the front, I could help her back with that. Throughout the work we divided little tasks between us and merged our work after every few tasks have completed, so that we both got to
    touch every part of the project. I think we were a great team and I’m proud of us and our work.<br><br>
